### What is it ?!

Child Care  Mini ERP provides several functionalties :
* a single webpage for any user wich displays child care facility (thereafter ccf) basic informations and news created on the fly by the ccf manager.
* an access to daily facts reports of registered and authorized familly members' children.
* a utility to send daily facts reports mails to every registered and authorised family members via a cron task an manage.py command.
* a basic admin mode for ccf manager (basic indicators, CRUD of employee, child, news, employee messages, familly members...)
* an application for ccf non-manager employees that provides a way to register/change/read daily facts for ccf children and provides an access to emergency contacts for a children as well as an easy way to check for allowed familly memmbers names and pictures when handing off child.

### Using

* manager : login via the "connexion" link of the home page to have access to your admin index interface. You then have the possibility to create/change/delete all ccf related elements. If acting as an employee you still have access to the employee app via the "Transmissions-urgences" link.
when creating a parent please be carefull to the "AccÃ¨s aux transmissions", "Autorisation de Prise en Charge" and "Contact en cas d'urgence" options as these define sensitive informations and permissions.
when creating an employee please be carefull to the "Direction" option if checked the employee will be allowed to access to the basic admin interface.

* employee : login via the "connexion" link of the home page to have access to your index interface. You can then consult the list of daily facts that you created or the list of ccf children where you can look at one child data/dailyfacys, note that you won't be allowed to delete any daily fact or to change a daily fact that you did not write.

* parents : login via the "connexion" link of the home page to have access to your index interface. You can then consult the list of your child and the list of daily facts written to date.
